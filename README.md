# Enigma
My attempt at making a virtual version of the enigma machine. Implements basic functionality of the army model of the machine with plugboard and five different rotors. Enables the user to code one letter at a time just as operators would have done with the original analogue. Very basic GUI as most of the work went into the backend side of things.
//TODO Write proper readme plus instructions on how the application works
